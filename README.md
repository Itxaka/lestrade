# Elemental Lestrade edition

POC: This uses the initial registration being passed by the user-data datasource.
So instead of injecting the iso, this is a generic iso that you can launch, pass the registration config as userdata and will register using that.

 - Create the iso (`make`)
 - Add the raw registration yaml as user data on whatever provider you use
 - Boot the iso
 - ?????
